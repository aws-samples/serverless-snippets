      "This pattern demonstrates parallel invocation with AWS Lambda durable functions. Multiple LLM calls execute concurrently, with each response checkpointed independently.",
      "The example sends multiple prompts about a topic in parallel, gathering different perspectives simultaneously.",
      "Benefits: Faster execution through concurrent LLM calls. Individual checkpointing means partial failures don't require re-running successful calls. Automatic retry handling for each parallel operation."

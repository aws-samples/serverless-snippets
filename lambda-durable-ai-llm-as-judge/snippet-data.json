      "This pattern demonstrates the LLM-as-judge pattern with AWS Lambda durable functions. Multiple models answer a question in parallel, then another LLM evaluates and selects the best response.",
      "All candidate answers and the final judgment are checkpointed for deterministic replay.",
      "Benefits: Parallel execution reduces total workflow time. Checkpointing prevents re-running expensive LLM calls on retry. Deterministic replay ensures consistent results."

      "This pattern demonstrates prompt chaining with AWS Lambda durable functions. Each LLM call is checkpointed, enabling automatic retry on failure and deterministic replay.",
      "The example generates a joke about a topic, then uses a second LLM call to review and rate the joke.",
      "Benefits: Expensive retries are avoided by resuming from the last checkpoint. Non-deterministic LLM outputs become deterministic through replay. Failed workflows don't restart from scratch."

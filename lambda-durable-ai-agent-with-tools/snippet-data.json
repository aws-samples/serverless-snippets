    "text": [
      "This pattern demonstrates an agentic loop with AWS Lambda durable functions. The LLM can call tools, and each model call and tool execution is checkpointed for deterministic replay.",
      "Tools can use durable context features like waitForCallback to suspend the agent while awaiting external input.",
      "Benefits: Complex agent loops are expressed as simple sequential code. Each tool call is checkpointed for resilient execution. Tools can suspend for human input without consuming compute resources."

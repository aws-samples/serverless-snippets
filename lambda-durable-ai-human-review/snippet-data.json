      "This pattern demonstrates human-in-the-loop workflows with AWS Lambda durable functions. The workflow suspends execution while awaiting human review without consuming compute resources.",
      "The example extracts fields from a document using an LLM, then waits for human approval before proceeding.",
      "Benefits: Pay only for active compute time, not wait periods. Workflows can suspend for up to one year. No infrastructure to manage while waiting for human input."
